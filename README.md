# Accessibility HTML Project

## Description

I wanted to show what I had learned the past week with HTML.
This project shows my current knowledge with HTML elements and CSS.
I learned how to refactor code and improve upon what I already had.

## Usage

To use this Accessibility HTML Project, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see the changes and impovements I have made with what I know so far.
